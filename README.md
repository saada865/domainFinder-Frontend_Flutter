This app includes a page that allows the user enter in a name, then a cool domain name will be generated by the Backend. The user then will be taken to GoDaddy.com from where the doamin purhcase option is given.
If the user isn't satisfied with the domian name then by pressing the "GET DOMAIN" button, the user will be presented with new domain names. 

This is the Frontend part of the App.
